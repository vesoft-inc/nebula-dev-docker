And the `vesoft/nebula-dev:centos7` image is also tagged as `vesoft/nebula-dev:latest`.

## Usage

At first, you should install `docker` in your machine and then pull the [`vesoft/nebula-dev`](https://hub.docker.com/r/vesoft/nebula-dev) image from docker hub.
After that you can use following commands to build `Nebula` sources.
